# Idempotent way to build a /etc/hosts file with Ansible using your Ansible hosts inventory for a source.
# Will include all hosts the playbook is run on.
# Inspired from http://xmeblog.blogspot.com/2013/06/ansible-dynamicaly-update-etchosts.html

#- name: Create /etc/hosts2 if it doesn't exist
#  file:
#    path: /etc/hosts2
#    state: touch
#
## The following worked with vagrant and ansible
#- name: Build /etc/hosts2 file
#  lineinfile:
#    dest=/etc/hosts2 
#    regexp='.*{{ item }}$'
#    line="{{ hostvars[item].nic1 }} {{ item }}.cs.siu.edu {{ item }}"
#    state=present
#  become: yes
#  when: hostvars[item]['nic1'] is defined
#  with_items: 
#    - "{{ groups['all'] }}"
#    #- "{{ groups['cephgroup'] }}"

- name: Add mappings to /etc/hosts
  blockinfile:
    path: /etc/hosts
    block: |
      {{ hostvars[item].nic1 }} {{ item }}.cs.siu.edu {{ item }}
    marker: "# {mark} ANSIBLE MANAGED BLOCK {{ item }}"
  with_items:
    - "{{ groups['all'] }}"
  when: hostvars[item]['nic1'] is defined

# The following only works with ansible, but not vagrant provision
#- name: Build /etc/hosts file
#  template:
#    src: hosts.j2
#    dest: /etc/hosts2
#    owner: root
#    group: root
#    mode: 0644
#    backup: no
